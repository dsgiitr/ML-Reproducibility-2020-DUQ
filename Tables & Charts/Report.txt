Two Moons:
Same results as that of paper ie
DUQ gives better uncertainity estimates
Single sided GP is not a good regularizer
GP with Ftheta is in consistent for results

FM:
Almost same results ie DUQ has better AUROC than DE, and same accuracy
DE(paper model) has more AUROC(FM+M) = 89 as mentioned in paper
DUQ has slightly less = 94.1 (92 95 95), observed slight inconsistency, still much more than DE

CIFAR10:
Same results as that of paper
Early stopping must be used for DUQ gp=0.5 at epoch=60
DE achieves best performance after 30 epochs itself

Rejection Classification:
Almost same results
On FM:
DE has better performance compared to paper results, still DUQ dominates
On CIFAR10:
Performance according to paper, ie DE has slight/negligible advantage

ROC on FM:
Same as paper ie DUQ outperforms

Histogram on CIFAR:
Same as paper ie
Confidence is spread out for ood but high for the actual test dataset

GP exp on FM:
gp=0.05 gave best validation accuracy on FM as described in paper

LS exp on FM:
Ls=0.1 gave the best AUROC(FM+M)as described in paper

Timing
Same results as paper ie
DUQ is much faster and slightly slower than single model at testing
DUQ without gp takes slighlty more time than single model at training
DUQ with gp takes twice/thrice more time than single model at training
DUQ gives the competitive edge
